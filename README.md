# Senko XRN1 Analysis

* This is my analysis repo for Senko, and the focus of this analysis is to identify DE modules between XRN1 KO and WT

* Lots of DEA analysis using DESeq2 and pathway enrichment analysis using `clusterProfiler` and `reactomePA`

* This is one of my early attempts at adopting version control faithfully along with R projects and setting all of that at the root level rather than in the R/ or scripts/ sub-directory

* The rationale here is that root-level execution ensures that code will run regardless of where the scripts are located or whether they get moved around
